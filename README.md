That's my emacs configuration, reborn. Thanks to [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package) and [straight.el](https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el). If you want to scale your configuration, you can't go too wrong reading their `README.md`s prior to copy-pasting snippets indiscriminately.
